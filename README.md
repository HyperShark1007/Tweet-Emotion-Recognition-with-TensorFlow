# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-with-TensorFlow

Developed and trained a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow to classify emotions in tweets. This project involved working with a large dataset of tweets, each categorized into one of six emotions, as part of a multi-class classification task within the natural language processing domain. Enhanced practical skills in neural networks, specifically RNNs, and gained hands-on experience with TensorFlow for text classification.
